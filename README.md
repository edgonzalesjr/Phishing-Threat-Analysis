## Objective

To understand and analyze a suspicious phishing email to identify potential security threats, while learning to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools for in-depth email investigation. Gain proficiency in evaluating email headers, SPF, and DMARC records to verify the authenticity of an email, and develop the skills to analyze email attachments for signs of malware or other malicious activities. Additionally, the topic emphasizes the importance of following incident response protocols, including forwarding suspicious emails to a Security Operations Center (SOC) for further analysis and mitigation of potential risks.

### Skills Learned

- Phishing Email Identification:
  - Recognizing phishing tactics such as unusual sender behavior, generic greetings, and unexpected requests.
  - Spotting red flags in email content, such as suspicious attachments or abnormal formatting.

- Email Header Analysis:
  - Extracting and analyzing critical metadata (e.g., senderâ€™s IP address, Return-Path domain) from email headers.
  - Understanding the importance of email headers in identifying the true origin of an email.

 - Use of OSINT Tools:
   - Utilizing tools like Whois, MxToolBox, VirusTotal, and dmarcian for investigating email origins, domains, and attachments.
   - Assessing the reputation of a domain or IP address to determine its legitimacy.

 - SPF and DMARC Record Evaluation:
   - Understanding the role of SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) records in email security.
   - Verifying if the email passed SPF and DMARC checks to determine its legitimacy.

 - Attachment Analysis:
   - Analyzing attachments for file type, size, and hash values to identify potential malware or malicious payloads.
   - Using tools like VirusTotal for malware scanning and identifying possible threats.

 - Incident Handling and Reporting:
   - Understanding the process of reporting suspicious emails to a Security Operations Center (SOC).
   - Recognizing the importance of proactive measures in mitigating potential security breaches.
